# Full Stack React App with a REST API
This is a Full Stack Create Courses Project.
The project allows a user to signup before creating a course, deleting a course and updating a course.

## These are the Technologies that I used in this project
* FOR REST API, DATABASE OR BACKEND: JavaScript, Node, Express, Sequelize, SQLite
* FOR CLIENT SIZE OR UI : JavaScript, React, Axios


## Start the REST API
Run the following commands from the api folder:

Firstly, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.
```
npm install
```

Secondly, seed the SQLite database.
```
npm run seed
```

And finally, start the application.
```
npm start
```

## Start the Client / UI
Run the following commands from the client folder:

Firstly, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.
```
npm install
```

And finally, start the application.
```
npm start
```
